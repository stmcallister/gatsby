title: Getting Started
---

The fastest way to get started with Gatsby + MDX is to use the [MDX
starter](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-starter-mdx-basic). This
allows you to write .mdx files in `src/pages` in order to create new pages on
your site.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. **Initialize the MDX starter** with the Gatsby CLI

   ```sh
   npx gatsby new my-mdx-starter https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-starter-mdx-basic
   ```

1. **Run the dev server** by changing directory to the scaffolded site and install dependencies

   ```sh
   cd my-mdx-starter/
   npm install
   gatsby develop
   ```

1. **Open the site** running at http://localhost:8000!

1. **Update the MDX content** by opening the `my-mdx-starter` directory
   in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.mdx`.
   Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## Add MDX to an existing Gatsby site

If you already have a Gatsby site that you'd like to add MDX to, you
can follow these steps for configuring the [gatsby-mdx](/packages/gatsby-mdx/) plugin:

1. **Add `gatsby-mdx`** and MDX as dependencies

   ```sh
   yarn add gatsby-mdx @mdx-js/mdx @mdx-js/tag
   ```

1. **Update your `gatsby-config.js`** to use the `gatsby-mdx` plugin

   ```javascript:title=gatsby-config.js
   module.exports = {
     plugins: [
       // ....
       `gatsby-mdx`,
     ],
   }
   ```

1. **Restart `gatsby develop`** and add an `.mdx` page to `src/pages`
