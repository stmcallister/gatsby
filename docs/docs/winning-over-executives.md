title: Winning Over Executives
---

Executives tend to care about both top-line (revenue) and bottom-line (profit), as well as overall company brand and image.

Most [benefits of Gatsby to marketers](/docs/winning-over-marketers) will also be appreciated by executives, especially revenue, conversion rates, and reduced page load times.

In addition, they will be interested to know that Gatsby can reduce infrastructure costs.

You might consider sharing a story, such as [how Escalade Sports reduced their hosting bill from $5,000 to $5 using Gatsby](/blog/2018-06-14-escalade-sports-from-5000-to-5-in-hosting/), rather than giving an in-depth technical explanation of how that works.
